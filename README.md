# seven-ch-multimeter
This simple device features an Ohm-meter, a diode-meter and a voltmeter with the (+) and (-) leads switched to several pin positions of a built-in DB-15 and HIROSE HR10A-10R-12P(73) connectors. The switching is done automatically by implementing seven internal relays controlled by a ESP32 device.
